Bootswatch-Sass
==========

Bootswatch-sass is a version of the [bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch) themes
packaged as scss and made for use as a bower component.

Usage
-----

Install it to your bower componenet using,

    bower install bootswatch-scss

In the styles file you wish to use it in you may have something
similar to,

    @import "bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/variables";
    @import "bootswatch-scss/readable/variables";
    @import "bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap";
    @import "bootswatch-scss/readable/bootswatch";

It seems you have to shuffle the variables import around to make it load correctly. Some variable files will require the original bootstrap variables before as well. See `global/build.scss` for a working example.
